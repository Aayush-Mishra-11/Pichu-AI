## Project Overview

**Pichu** is a modular, AI-powered personal assistant that can:
- Understand user queries using intent recognition (SVM/TF-IDF)
- Automate OS tasks (open apps, control system settings)
- Answer general questions using Google Gemini API
- Perform web searches, fetch weather, tell jokes/facts
- Analyze images (OCR and face detection)
- Interact via a modern web UI with voice input/output

This project demonstrates full-stack development, AI/ML integration, and practical automation.

---

## Feature List

- **Intent Recognition:** Classifies user queries using SVM and TF-IDF.
- **Gemini API Fallback:** Handles open-ended or unknown queries with Google Gemini.
- **OS Automation:** Open Notepad, Calculator, File Explorer, Command Prompt, etc.
- **System Control:** Adjust volume, brightness, WiFi, shutdown, restart, sleep.
- **Web Search:** Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, ChatGPT.
- **Weather Info:** Fetches real-time weather for any city.
- **Jokes & Facts:** Responds with random jokes and facts.
- **Image Analysis:** Extracts text and detects faces from uploaded images.
- **Voice Input/Output:** Uses browser and backend TTS for speech.
- **Conversation History:** Remembers previous exchanges for context.
- **Modern Web UI:** Responsive chat interface with voice and file upload.

## Intent Recognition (AI/ML)

- **Model:** SVM (Support Vector Machine) with TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Purpose:** Classifies user queries into predefined intents (greeting, weather, jokes, etc.).
- **How it works:**  
  - User input is vectorized using TF-IDF.
  - SVM predicts the intent.
  - If intent is recognized, a random response from that intent is returned.

---

## Fallback to Gemini API

- **When used:** If the user's query does not match any known intent.
- **How it works:**  
  - The query (and optionally recent conversation context) is sent to Gemini.
  - Gemini generates a concise, relevant response.
- **Prompting:** The prompt is prefixed with instructions to keep responses short and clear.

---

## Automation Features

- **OS Automation:** Open apps (Notepad, Calculator, etc.), control system settings (volume, brightness, WiFi), shutdown/restart/sleep.
- **Web Automation:** Open Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, ChatGPT, Brave browser.
- **Weather:** Fetches weather using OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Music:** Play, list, and control music playback.

---

## Image Analysis

- **OCR:** Uses pytesseract to extract text from images.
- **Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV to detect faces in uploaded images.
- **Web Integration:** Users can upload images via the web UI; backend processes and returns results.

---

## Voice Features

- **Voice Input:** Uses Web Speech API for speech-to-text in the browser.
- **Voice Output:** Uses Web Speech API for TTS in the browser; uses pyttsx3 for TTS in CLI mode.
- **Voice Selection:** Users can choose their preferred voice in the web UI.

---

## Frontend (Web UI)

- **index.html:** Responsive chat interface with voice and file upload.
- **script.js:** Handles chat logic, voice input/output, and file uploads.
- **style.css:** Custom styles for the UI.
- **pichu.png:** Assistant logo.

---

## How to Add More Intents

1. Open `Model.py`.
2. Add a new intent to the `intents` dictionary:
   ```python
   "new_intent": {
       "patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
       "responses": ["response1", "response2"]
   }
   ```
3. Retrain the model if needed.

---

## How to Run/Deploy

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up API keys in `config.json` if needed.
3. Run the backend:
   ```
   python Backend/app.py
   ```
4. Open the web UI at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Web Speech API voices are limited by the user's OS/browser.
- Gemini API requires an API key and internet connection.
- Some OS automation features may not work on all platforms.
- No user authentication or personalization yet.

---

## Future Work & Improvements

- Add user authentication and personalization.
- Integrate reminders and calendar features.
- Use a cloud TTS API for more natural speech.
- Add a mobile app or PWA support.
- Improve context memory with embeddings or vector database.
- Add more automation and smart home integration.
